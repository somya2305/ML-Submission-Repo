In the given project we need to classify whether a person lives or not based on the given train and test data.
The feature set have the following columns-'Pclass','Sex,'Age','SibSp','Parch','Fare','Embarked' and 'has_cabin'. The column ‘has_cabin’
have the value 1 if the given person has a cabin and 0 if not.
The given feature set is firstly pre-processed. The ‘Sex’ have value ‘female’ and ‘male’. As numbers are easier to handle thus this data 
is converted into numeric data by assigning 0 for female and 1 for male. 
Similarly, the ‘Embarked’ feature set have values ‘S’,’C’ and ‘Q’ which is converted to 0,1 and 2. This is done by using ‘Label Encoder’ 
in the scikit learn library.
There are some missing values in the data. The missing values in the AGE feature set are filled with random number between the 
(mean – standard deviation) and (mean+ standard deviation) so that the missing value do not alter the results much.
Then all the data is scaled before applying a classification technique.
I have used logistic regression to classify the data by using ‘lbfgs’ solver as it was giving maximum accuracy among all the solvers of 
the logistic regression.
Accuracy of the model in train cases is 0.8114478114478114
F1 Score of the model in train cases is 0.7341772151898733.


Accuracy of the model on kaggle is 0.77511.
